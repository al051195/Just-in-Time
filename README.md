 - MacOS 26 Tahoe on Apple Silicon or newer
   
 - iOS 26 or newer
   
 - iPadOS 26 or newer

 - [SideStore](https://sidestore.io) / [AltStore](https://altstore.io) / [LiveContainer](https://github.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer)

## Installation :
- You must use Alstore / SideStore, or if you have LiveContainer, you can use it.
- The Mac version only works on Apple Silicon Macs, as it works with the macOS compatibility layer for iPadOS/iOS. It's unsigned, so I don't even know if it will work on your Mac.
- For iPadOS: I'm using my iPhone for testing. If anything doesn't work on iPad, please let me know.
But it should work just like on iOS (you'll need to sideload it or use LiveContainer).
