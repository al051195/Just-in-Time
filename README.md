Feature :
- you can setup multiple timer
- slik liquid glass design
- alarm
- timer
- stopwatch

It's only a little project that i do when I have time so don't expect frequent update.
If you have some idea of feature or if you have some bugs / issue tell me.

Installation :
- you need to use alstore / sidestore or if you have livecontainer you can use it
- the mac version only work on apple silicon macs since it work trought the compatibility layer of macos for ipadOS/iOS app
  and its not signed so I dont even know if it's gon a work on your mac
- for ipadOS : I use my iPhone for testing so if some thing are not looking great ob ipad tell me
  but normaly its gonna work the same way as iOS ( you need to sideload it or use livecontainer )
